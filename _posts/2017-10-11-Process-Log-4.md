“Change is neither strictly “oppositional” nor does it occur as a natural, linear progression.”

I got this quote while we were reading the interview of Myung Mi Kim and I found it really interesting and thoughtful, and true. I’ve noticed through my own life, that my changing behaviors have been changing overtime, with little bumps along the way. I remember thinking that this way of “changing” was better than another way at the time, but then I realized that it was actually better the way I had thought it wrong previously. 

I think of human life this way. Change is always sporadic and it comes when you least expect it, especially in moments outside of your comfort zone. I’ve realized this over the past few years, so I’ve been trying to become more open to such changes in my environment, my relationships, and myself. I think that our greatest advantage as humans is our ability to adapt to things. There is a bit of a slow realization that we’ll be forever changing and that it’s a good way to morph into our changing environments, especially when it comes to going out of your comfort zone. 

Over the past year, I’ve gone to many places I wouldn’t have otherwise because it didn’t fit my “perfect” criteria of me being well fed, well slept, under no pressure, surrounded by people I knew, and warm. I really think that college has changed me to be more relaxed and open to exploring new ideas with friends and potentially people you don’t know. I’ve learned that these experiences are the ones truly worth living for because what you’ll learn from them is unexpected.


“Change can’t act out its potential to be radicalizing or oppositional. In a way it’s almost immediately used up as fodder for the machinery that maintains those limits and perimeters of what’s inside and outside, what’s different and what’s not. So in a way, it hasn’t played out its full course before it gets preempted and folded into something else.”

Can you really effect change if the culture in which you’re operating can’t even begin to recognize the fact that your unrecognizability is making a contribution? It’s kinda like switching a song before you even get to the end of the song. Are you truly enjoying the music and the beats of the song if all you’re doing is hopping between one and the other. 

I think change is the same. We are often striving for change so badly that we begin to forget to enjoy the things around us at the times of change. From people to experiences, there are many things that we overlook when focusing on ourselves and bettering us.
