change is neither strictly "oppositional" nor does it occur as a natural, linear progression.

change can't act out its potential to be radicalizing or oppositional. In a way it's almost immediately used up as fodder for the machinery that maintains those limits and perimeters of what's inside and outside, what's different and what's not. So in a way, it hasn't played out its full course before it gets preempted and folded into something else.

Can you really effect change if the culture in which you're operating can't even begin to recognize the fact that your unrecognizability is making a contribution?
