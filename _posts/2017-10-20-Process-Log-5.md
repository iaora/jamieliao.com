It’s about midway through the semester, and HackRU just got done! It’s quite exciting. 

It was my first time running HackRU alongside Brandon and I think things went really well. People have even remarked saying that this HackRU was the smoothest of all HackRU’s thus far. However, I don’t think that the credit is ours to take at all- I personally think that it was everyone doing their jobs and doing it well. 

I will admit that I slacked on a few things and I have a whole list of things to improve for next semester, so I hope to utilize our time wisely and improve the overall event. I think the biggest thing that I needed to do better was get organized. We would have weekly meetings with each team and they all told me various tasks and things that they needed to get done, but I had a difficult time keeping track of these tasks and checking up on them every so often. But since then, I’ve made an effort to use Asana to keep track of each team’s goals and tasks and I hope that it’ll help with that. We’ll see in due time. 

I also recently just finished making my first neuron in my Brain in Computing class! It’s so cool and a lot less complicated than I thought. It’s literally using loops and variables to truly mimic a neuron and its behavior in nature. Although, I had the help of a tutorial and various resources, the assignment itself wasn’t that bad. Just like anything in computer science, the hard part is thinking of an implementation and then the coding is easy. This is just like Operating Systems, which I’m currently en route to take next semester. I’ve heard that it’s difficult in thinking of the implementation, but the actual code itself is only 100 lines long. 

I think the 1 single thing that influenced me to major in CS is the endless problem solving. I love problem solving and the fact that there are endless means of achieving your goal and no one route is right. There are however more efficient ways, but that simply means “better,” but not right.
