# Why did I choose CS?
What made me major in CS? I initially applied for Rutgers’ School of Engineering as a BME but got rejected (thankfully because I soon realized that I hate bio and chem). Therefore, I had to think of another major. I had enjoyed learning the material in AP CS and the problem solving aspect to the class, so I decided to major in CS the August before college. However, I had a tough time convincing myself to do CS because I’d heard that you need to be amazing at math (which I’m not- I think I got a C/C+ in Algebra 2) and have a burning passion for coding (which I don’t). In addition, I hadn’t done the best in high school- I think I was performing the second worst amongst my friend group. I had felt incompetent that I could succeed in the field because I thought that CS would be something terribly difficult for someone with my grades.

I stumbled across this quote sometime in high school and I thought it was, and still is, super relevant to me. I had realized that my C’s in high school in history, chemistry, or biology were not representative of what I am good at. In fact, I’ve realized that I’m absolutely horrible at and do not enjoy classes that are solely memorizing so I’ve avoided them altogether. I realized that I excel at classes that require problem solving and creating new ideas- which is exactly the foundations of CS. This goes for any other major or field of study. Realize what your strengths and weakness are and acknowledge them. Work to be better at the things you suck and excel at the things you’re great.

# Life in Computer Science

Being a CS student is something that I find extremely fun yet frustrating. There will be nights where you’re pull all nighters to finish that one project you overestimated and started the night before its due date. Nearly everyone goes through one of those. But you’ll have friends with you that will encourage you to pull through and you can get the help that you need from your peers, professors, TAs, etc. I especially love CS because it’s such a wide field of study and you can do nearly anything you want.. Which brings me to my next point.

What exactly can I do with CS degree? If you’re interested in business, you can start a company with a CS degree. For example, my friend Mike Swift who is a Rutgers alumn went to start a company called [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io/) aka MLH. If you guys don’t know MLH, they’re the one company that oversees most student hackathons. If you want to work at a bank, nearly all banks are hiring software engineers (like Capital One, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, etc.). If you like to help people, you can create various products that will help locate the nearest public bathroom or food drive in NYC (someone actually built this!) If you like to design or draw, you can go into graphic design and create websites. If you like working with data, you can go into data analysis where you work with databases. If you like working with hardware, you can become a hardware engineer to build new circuits.

The gender ratio at Rutgers, like most other places, is a pretty low ratio of female to males. It’s about 23% female in our Intro to CS class of about 1000 students. This number decreases to 15% in our algorithms class.

Now this may all seem a little intimidating, but it’s all super fun and you’ll meet amazing people along the way. As with anything, the key to succeeding is to start early not to get ahead of others (although it is a bonus), but rather to **figure out what you enjoy**. I’ve met many people who decided junior year of college that they wanted to pursue a CS degree. In fact, many come back for a second degree. Be sure that this is something you enjoy and truly enjoy doing what you do.

# Start Early

## Take a CS Class
Take AP CS! The material in this class helped me a ton when I took the intro class at Rutgers. Nearly all of the information that Mr Wasserman teaches you in this class will be taught in the intro level class, if not more. For example, in our intro class the final consisted of:
  - Types, arrays, Strings, methods, OOP, searching/sorting, recursion, efficiency analysis.. almost everything you’ve learned in AP CS (I think except for Big-O?)

Even if you didn’t do too hot in the class (for example I barely got a B), don’t worry. I didn’t truly understand OOP until my second CS class at Rutgers and I still don’t understand recursion. 

## Build a project
![alt](http://www.codingdojo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Indeed-Job-Postings.jpg)
Start following some guides/tutorials online that teach you how to make a web application or learn a new language. I would recommend starting with learning new languages like python! A lot of companies look for experience in python or Java!

Make your personal site :) It will teach you how to use HTML/CSS/Javascript and other frameworks that can help you make your website look pretty. 

## Make a [Github](https://github.com/)

It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere and allows for collaboration on code with partners. Github is a great place for you to keep code that you’re working on at home and access it at school. It’s also a great place for you to work on projects and store your programs.

Its also great for hosting your personal website! If youre interested, follow [this tutorial](https://pages.github.com/) to make your own custom website!

## Attend Hackathons

Youve probably heard hackathon this hackathon that. But what exactly is a hackathon? According to MLH, a hackathon is best described as an “invention marathon”. Anyone who has an interest in technology attends a hackathon to learn, build & share their creations over the course of a weekend in a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere.

Ive met all of my closest friends as a result of hackathons. I either met them while organizing HackRU or I met them at the actual event while we walked around NYC or Phili. They're truly a great place to meet people you wouldn't meet otherwise at your own school. For example, Millburn has a hackathon! :)

I also love going to hackathons because the environment helps me realize how much I don't know when it comes to tech and it encourages me to learn even more! When I went to my first hackathon, PennApps Spring 2016, I realized how little I knew about tech outside of the classroom. Here I learned about python, web dev, mobile dev, and ultimately how little I knew about these technologies that my friends were using. This slingshotted me into wanting to learn about web dev, which my mentor and I did later in the year!

# Succeeding in College
Some little tips and tricks I’ve learned from college and I teach my students in Intro to CS and Data Structures

## Get Involved in the Community
Getting involved in the community is hands down the best thing I’ve done at my time at Rutgers. It was my fall semester of sophomore year and I just felt so alone. I wanted to change my life so I sucked it up and went out to the real world. I found a CS mentor to guide me through my life at Rutgers + work on a project that we’d get paid for! It was super awesome because this experience opened up so many doors. I can confidently say that everything I’ve achieved up to thus far is because of my mentor. He forced me to go out and meet people and literally nagged me until I went to a hackathon in Phili in a blizzard that shaped my CS career. 

**Find what you enjoy**. There are many clubs at schools and join whatever club you like because you’ll meet amazing people. But don’t join too many. I was on the e-board of 2 major clubs, working 3 jobs, and 16 credits → I got burnt out by the middle of the semester. You don’t have to be a part of everything

## Start Your Projects Early
Realistically- how many of you start your assignments the night before it’s due? I still do that haha, especially for my non-CS classes. However, I will say that you should not procrastinate your coding assignments until the night before. Maybe in the intro classes it’ll be okay, but once you reach the higher level classes, your assignments will take you more than 1 night to do. Planning, coding, and testing take a lot of time, especially if you don’t know what to do. I once spent 3 hours just staring at my recursion assignment to understand what the hell I had to do. 

Once thing I’ve noticed with my students is that they do not ask questions. I teach a recitation for Intro to CS that has 9 students and I feel like I’m talking to myself at times. I notice that some of them are struggling with the question, but they don’t ask for guidance. If you’re stuck, please please ask for help because everyone is absolutely willing to help. 

## Improve your Programming
Learning more programming languages this early will give you a huge advantage in the work field. SQL, Java, and Python are amongst the top 3 highest demanded programming languages in 2017. So it’ll help a lot to learn them!! 

Learning good coding practices is vital. A friend of mine at Google actually told me that Google finds that students are lacking in modular programming (separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules). Please don’t do something like this code haha it’s a little exaggerated, but it’s something along the same lines. If you can code something in 1 line, why would you want to take 10 lines to do it?

Please don't do something like this: ![alt](https://img.devrant.io/devrant/rant/r_482216_yKjGe.jpg).. :(

## Go to Even More Hackathons
When you get to college, there are a ton more options for hackathons that open up because a few of them may not publicly accept high schoolers (like HackRU.. But I’ll let you in don’t worry). I personally love going to hackathons because they motivate me to build projects and learn new things. I push myself to compete with my friends who are already making a project and create something useful or stupid. 

Hackathons are also great for resume building because you make projects there! Tech companies prefer looking at your projects over many other things, so having a ton of projects that showcase your skill and determination is amazing for landing that internship you want in the future. 

Some local hackathons include HackPrinceton, PennApps, HackNJIT, HackTCNJ, HackNY, HackRU, and HackKean. All MLH hackathons can be found [here](https://mlh.io/seasons/na-2017/events)!

## Get Experience
Lastly, getting a job is the end goal after college. In order to do so quite easily, you will need to gain experience from either internships, projects, hackathons, or even teaching. When I was applying to a few jobs, they actually mentioned that TAing for a class is a bonus! This is a good [website](http://www.intern.supply/) for looking up companies who are hiring! The big name companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, etc. all tend to hire in early Fall, so make sure that your resume is up to date! Smaller companies are free to hire whenever- in fact, I didn't get my current internship offer until late March.
